# vtkRectilinearGrid-Mapping
This ParaView Programmable Filter script extracts data from a vtkPolyData dataset and maps it onto a vtkRectilinearGrid. It processes multiple time steps, extracts salinity values at various depths, and stores them in a 2D array to populate the vtkRectilinearGrid, which can then be visualized in ParaView.
